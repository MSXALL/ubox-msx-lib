# What's new?

## Release 1.1.6 - 2021-06-07

 - `png2sprites.py`: Added a new `-c` flag to include the frame colour as
   a comment. This works as a reference and should make easier assign colours
   to frames later on in the game's code
 - `map.py`: remove bin files on error, fixed an error in error reporting
 - `png2tiles.py`: support to load the tileset combinng multiple images
